## Using

To build, simply use g++ with the C++11 option, e.g.
```
g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -O2 src/*cpp -o amc
```
and then execute by typing
./amc

## To-Do 
1. Argument passing and file reads
2. "Simulation control" input files, in addition to data input files
3. More flexible output
4. Relative velocity comparisons.

of course, also
0. Finish coding the classes
